## 2024-06-03 - Centralize MCP Hook Input Reading
**Vulnerability:** Duplicated logic across multiple MCP hooks for reading JSON payloads from stdin (`sys.stdin.read(1024 * 1024)`), which parses user input and exits on failure. This creates a maintenance burden and increases the risk of inconsistencies or vulnerabilities (like DoS via unbounded reads or mishandled parsing) if one hook implements it differently.
**Learning:** Security mechanisms like bounded input reading and validation should be centralized into shared utility functions (e.g., `read_mcp_hook_input` in `mcp_common.py`) rather than copied and pasted across multiple entry points, adhering to the DRY principle and improving defense-in-depth consistency across the ecosystem.
**Prevention:** Centralize recurring security-critical logic, especially I/O handling and validation, into a shared `mcp_common.py` library and use it universally across all hooks to ensure uniform security controls.

## 2025-05-15 - Fix Path Traversal Vulnerability in marketplace scripts
**Vulnerability:** Weak path traversal checks in `scripts/check_version_freshness.py` and `scripts/validate_marketplace.py` relied on `os.path.normpath` and `startswith("..")`, which could be bypassed via symlinks or absolute paths.
**Learning:** Robust path validation requires resolving paths fully using `os.path.realpath` and verifying that the resolved path is contained within the intended base directory using `os.path.commonpath`.
**Prevention:** Use a centralized `get_safe_path` utility for all file system operations involving user-supplied or external paths to ensure they remain within the project boundary.

## 2024-06-12 - Fix Token Leakage on Cross-Origin Redirects
**Vulnerability:** The `scripts/check_version_freshness.py` script fetched GitHub API data using `urllib.request.urlopen` with a GitHub token in the `Authorization` header. If the API returned a redirect to a different domain, the default `HTTPRedirectHandler` passed the `Authorization` header to the new origin, creating an SSRF data-leakage risk.
**Learning:** Python's default `urllib` redirect handlers automatically forward all headers to the redirect target. Sensitive headers, particularly `Authorization` and `Cookie`, must be explicitly stripped when following cross-origin redirects to prevent token exfiltration.
**Prevention:** To prevent `Authorization` header leakage (SSRF) during HTTP redirects when using Python's `urllib.request`, the project uses a custom `NoAuthRedirectHandler` (inheriting from `urllib.request.HTTPRedirectHandler`) that explicitly strips sensitive headers like `Authorization` and `Cookie` when the redirect destination hostname differs from the original request hostname.

## 2025-06-14 - Bound IPC/Stdin Reads to Mitigate Exhaustion DoS
**Vulnerability:** The centralized `read_mcp_hook_input` function in `plugins/mcp_common.py` read up to 1MB of JSON payload from stdin (`sys.stdin.read(1024 * 1024)`). This unnecessarily large limit poses an resource exhaustion/DoS risk for MCP hooks where expected inputs are typically small metadata dictionaries.
**Learning:** Even when centralizing security controls, overly permissive bounds (like reading 1MB from stdin for small payloads) fail the principle of least privilege for resource allocation and increase susceptibility to malicious or malformed input exhaustion.
**Prevention:** Hard limit bounded IPC/stdin reads to the minimum required size (e.g., 64KB instead of 1MB) to prevent large input exhaustion vulnerabilities and enforce stricter defense-in-depth on data pipelines.
