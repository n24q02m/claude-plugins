"""PostToolUse hook: ask for a rebuild when a branch move outran the graph.

Runs after shell calls and reacts only to commands that move the branch
(``git pull``, ``git merge``). It deliberately does **not** re-index anything.

The bundled incremental hook already fires on the same event and widens its
diff base from ``HEAD~1`` to the commit recorded at the last build, so an
ordinary ``git pull`` -- however many commits it brings in -- is already
covered. Re-indexing here would spend a second process spawn on every shell
call for no additional coverage.

What the incremental pass cannot do is recover when the recorded commit is no
longer reachable. After a rebase, an amended history, or a force-pushed
branch, that base fails validation and the pass silently falls back to
``HEAD~1``, leaving everything else the branch move brought in unindexed. The
graph then looks current while describing code that no longer exists.

This hook detects exactly that case and asks for a full rebuild. Anything it
cannot prove, it stays quiet about: a false alarm on every pull would train
the reader to ignore it.
