# Better Godot MCP -- Manual Setup Guide

> **Note**: Plugin install (Method 1) uses stdio mode -- no auth required for godot.
> The previous default of HTTP transport has been changed to stdio.
> If you relied on HTTP mode, set `MCP_TRANSPORT=http` or pass `--http` flag.

## Method overview

This plugin **defaults to stdio via plugin install** (`uvx`/`npx`) -- the simplest path and the one this guide covers in full. It also ships Docker images (`:stdio` and `:http` targets) and supports HTTP transport (`MCP_TRANSPORT=http` / `--http`) for self-hosting. What it does **not** offer (unlike `better-notion-mcp`/`better-email-mcp`/`better-telegram-mcp`) is a hosted remote-relay/OAuth mode -- HTTP here is self-host only.

For comparison, the other 6 plugins in this stack (`better-notion-mcp`, `better-email-mcp`, `better-telegram-mcp`, `wet-mcp`, `mnemo-mcp`, `imagine-mcp`) document 3 methods:
1. **Default** -- Plugin install (`uvx`/`npx`) stdio
2. **Fallback** -- Docker stdio (Windows/macOS PATH issues)
3. **Recommended** -- Docker HTTP (multi-device, OAuth/relay form, claude.ai web)

> **⚠️ Mutually exclusive — pick ONE per plugin**: Do NOT stack `/plugin install` AND a user `mcpServers` override (Docker stdio or HTTP) — both would load simultaneously and create duplicate entries (plugin's `npx`/`uvx` stdio + your override). Plugin matching is by **endpoint** (URL or command string) per CC docs, not by name — and `npx`/`uvx` ≠ `docker` ≠ HTTP URL, so all three are distinct endpoints. Choosing the Docker stdio or HTTP self-host path means losing the plugin's skills/agents/hooks/commands. For full plugin features, use the default plugin install (Method 1) documented below.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 24.14.1
- **Godot Engine** 4.x installed (required for `run`, `stop`, `export` actions; optional for scene/script editing)
- A Godot 4.x project with a `project.godot` file

## Method 1: Claude Code Plugin (Recommended)

### Credential prompts at install

When you run `/plugin install`, Claude Code prompts you for the following credentials (declared in `userConfig` per CC docs). Sensitive values are stored in your system keychain and persist across `/plugin update`:

| Field | Required | Where to obtain |
|---|---|---|
| `GODOT_PATH` | Optional | Absolute path to Godot 4.x binary; auto-detect from PATH if empty |
| `GODOT_PROJECT_PATH` | Optional | Default project root (can override per tool call) |

### Steps

1. Open Claude Code in your terminal.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   /plugin marketplace add n24q02m/claude-plugins
   /plugin install better-godot-mcp@n24q02m-plugins
   ```
3. The plugin auto-configures the MCP server in stdio mode -- no prompts, no env vars required, it just works.

Optionally set `GODOT_PROJECT_PATH` to point at your Godot project directory; otherwise pass `project_path` per tool call.

## Environment Variable Reference

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|:---------|:---------|:--------|:------------|
| `GODOT_PROJECT_PATH` | No | -- | Default Godot project directory. Each tool call can also pass `project_path` as a parameter. |
| `GODOT_PATH` | No | Auto-detected | Explicit path to the Godot binary. If not set, the server searches PATH and common install locations (Windows, macOS, Linux). |
| `MCP_TRANSPORT` | No | `stdio` | Set to `http` to run in HTTP mode (advanced; not in scope of this guide). The `--http` CLI flag is equivalent. |
| `PORT` | No | `0` (auto) | HTTP port when `MCP_TRANSPORT=http`. Set explicitly when you need a stable port. |

## Troubleshooting

### Server starts but tools fail with "project not found"

- Ensure your Godot project has a `project.godot` file at its root.
- Set `GODOT_PROJECT_PATH` to the directory containing `project.godot`, or pass `project_path` in each tool call.

### Godot binary not detected

- Install Godot 4.x and ensure it is on your PATH, or set `GODOT_PATH` to the full path of the Godot executable.
- Use the `config` tool with action `detect_godot` to see where the server is looking.

### Docker: "permission denied" or empty file listings

- Ensure the volume mount path is correct: `-v /absolute/path:/project`.
- On Linux, you may need to add `:z` to the mount flag for SELinux: `-v /path:/project:z`.

### npx: "command not found" or old version

- Verify Node.js >= 24.14.1: `node --version`.
- Clear the npx cache: `npx --yes clear-npx-cache` or use `@latest` tag: `npx -y @n24q02m/better-godot-mcp@latest`.

### Tools return errors about Godot 3.x

- This server requires Godot 4.x project structure. Godot 3.x projects are not supported.
